<h2>About the Hyperpixel 4 Mount</h2>

<p>The Hyperpixel 4 Mount for Voron 2.4 is a full solution for mounting the Hyperpixel 4 display by Pimoroni attached to a Raspberry Pi 3/4 via GPIO to a Voron 2.4 3D printer. This requires fully replacing the front skirt to your Voron 2.4 with a new bespoke solution that allows the almost vertical mounting of the Raspberry Pi directly behind the Hyperpixel Display. </p>

<p>The solution includes several 3D printable parts, a full visual manual, Hyperpixel configuration for Klipper Screen and more.</p>
