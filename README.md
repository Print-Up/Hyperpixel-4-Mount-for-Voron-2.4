## About the Hyperpixel 4 Mount</h2>

The Hyperpixel 4 Mount for Voron 2.4 is a full solution for mounting the Hyperpixel 4 display by Pimoroni attached to a Raspberry Pi 3/4 via GPIO to a Voron 2.4 3D printer. This requires fully replacing the front skirt to your Voron 2.4 with a new bespoke solution that allows the almost vertical mounting of the Raspberry Pi directly behind the Hyperpixel Display.

The solution includes several 3D printable parts, a full visual manual, Hyperpixel configuration for Klipper Screen and more.

## Hyperpixel Raspberry Pi Configuration

**Using Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye?**

Support for the Hyperpixel is built right into the OS, so no need to download anything! We just need to make some changes to the `/boot/config.txt` file as well as creating a new configuration for the screen rotation
